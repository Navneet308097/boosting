# Boosting

This project demonstrates the concept of **Boosting**, a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model. Boosting improves accuracy by training models sequentially, where each new model focuses on the errors of the previous one.

## Overview

Boosting is widely used in both classification and regression tasks.
It works by giving more weight to misclassified or poorly predicted samples, allowing the model to correct mistakes step by step.
As a result, Boosting reduces bias and improves overall performance.

## Features

* Sequential training of weak learners
* Focuses on correcting previous prediction errors
* Reduces bias and improves accuracy
* Works well with various datasets and noise levels
* Can be applied to both classification and regression problems

## Description

In Boosting, multiple simple models (often decision trees with small depth) are trained one after another.
Each model learns from the mistakes of the previous one by adjusting sample weights or residuals.

By the end of the process, all the weak learners are combined to produce a strong final prediction. The method demonstrates:

* Improved model stability
* Better handling of complex patterns
* Strong performance even with minimal tuning

This project highlights how Boosting techniques can outperform many traditional models by building strong predictors from weak components.
